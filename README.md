# synthetic-cartography

synthetic-cartography is an attempt to map the parameter space of a hardware synthesizer by exploring
random parameter selections (or patches) and the sounds they produce, i hope to eventually create
more intuitive or expressive methods of creating sounds using a hardware synth.
